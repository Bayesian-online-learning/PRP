# A new online learning algorithm for streaming data and decision support with a Bayesian approach

 This repository provides Matlab code for simulations in the paper "A new online learning algorithm for streaming data and decision support with a Bayesian approach". It contains three Matlab files.

1. Est_Tao_Delta.m: a function that implements the algorithm to detect change point $\tau$ and estimate the jump magnitude $\delta$.
2. online_learning.m: a function that combines Component A and Component B and outputs the corresponding sequence and regret sequence.
3. Example.m: it provides two simulation examples and produces graphs.
4. real_data.m: provides real data analysis
